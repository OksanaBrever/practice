            <p><strong>LONDON: Liverpool added another fairytale comeback to the history books as they fought back 
               <br>from 3-1 down against 
                Borussia Dortmund to reach the Europa League semi-finals after Dejan Lovren’s towering stoppage-time header 
               <br>secured a 4-3 win on Thursday.
               </strong>
            </p>
            <p>Lovren rose at the far post to rifle home his header in the first minute of added time 
               <br> recalling memories of Liverpool’s 2005 Champions League final comeback against 
               <br> AC Milan and propelling them into the last four <mark> with a 5-4 aggregate victory </mark>.
            </p>
            <p>Liverpool, 2-0 down after nine minutes <time> 15.04.2016 10:09 pm </time>, will be joined in Friday’s draw by holders Sevilla,
               <br>who needed a penalty shootout to edge past Spanish rivals Athletic Bilbao.
               <br>Spain will have two sides in the last four after Villarreal beat Sparta Prague 
               <br>4-2 and 6-3 over the two legs,while Shakhtar Donetsk defeated Braga 4-0 at home 
               <bt>to complete a 6-1 aggregate triumph.
